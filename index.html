			Artificial intelligence (AI) has penetrated deeply into healthcare and is expected to dominate health informatics in the next decade. Chatbots are used to serve as a middleman between health specialists and app consumers. We observe that chatbots have already advanced significantly from their origins in platforms that were primarily focused on basic information retrieval. Chatbots are able to provide support to patients suffering from various conditions.</br>  Rwanda, like many other developing countries, faces challenges in providing widespread access to healthcare services. There is a notable shortage of healthcare professionals, including pharmacists, which can lead to delays and gaps in service delivery.

			The Rwandan government has shown a strong commitment to leveraging digital health technologies to improve healthcare delivery. Initiatives like the Rwanda Health Management Information System (RHMIS) and the use of drones for medical supply delivery underscore this commitment. The development and implementation of the Pharmaceutical AI Chatbot Management System are often a result of collaborations between the government, healthcare providers, and technology companies.

			I know someone who fell ill and the doctor prescribed medication that didn’t match her condition due to an error made by the doctor.  That’s why I have a dream of doing the chatbot that can serve both healthcare providers and patients reliable information on medications, dosage guidelines, and potential drug interactions by enhancing quality of healthcare services in Rwanda.
